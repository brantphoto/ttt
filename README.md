TIC TAC TOE - ANY SIZE BOARD, ANY SIZE WIN CONDITION

+++This is a project that has been worked on or is currently being worked on by the following people: Brandon Kwong, Criselda Valderrama, Blaise Thomas, Alexis Gormly, and myself (Brant Barger). Thanks to all involved so far+++

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A note to anyone who's going to be participating in improving this Tic Tac Toe game. I'm making a BRANCH: Dev, and that's the branch you should fork. Doing this for so many reasons but a big one is just practicing a proper Github opensource workflow. Any suggestions to the workflow just let me know. 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Features to add to this game: 
-Hide board when you first open page
-Add menus that control board size and win condition variables
-Button to start game
-Game finishing upon win announcement (none yet) 
-refactoring of win-announcements
-restart button
-tie resolution (none yet)
-Make it pretty! Ugly as a geocities page.


Things to add eventually:
-More than two players?
-Some sort of other game involving the logic of checking spaces around it?

Lastly:
It would be nice if the code was commented well to explain the logic to all. I'm going to work on that as wel. 



Cheers, 
Brant
